    <h2>Write Up</h2>
    <h3>Design Decisions:</h3>
    <p>For this project, our group decided to use a side-by-side map layout to allow direct comparison of 
        cloud probability between two different times. This layout enables users to see spatial differences 
        without having to hover over the map. Cloud probability (ACM category) is represented with distinct 
        colors to encode categorical data. We implemented tooltips that display coordinates and cloud probability 
        when a user hovers over a point. Additionally, we included synchronized zooming, so that when a user zooms 
        in on one map, the same magnification is applied to the other map, helping users make a detailed 
        comparison between the two time periods in California. Beyond zooming, we also enabled panning after 
        zooming, allowing users to explore different areas of the maps without needing to re-magnify. We also 
        included major cities of California to give the viewer some perspective on what a city they probably know 
        experiences in terms of their clouds.<br><br>

    One alternative we considered was using a single map with a time slider to display cloud probability at 
    different hours. We ultimately decided against this because a slider shows progression over time, rather 
    than allowing direct comparison between two specific periods. Another alternative was displaying a larger 
    area, but this approach was quickly rejected because it was computationally intensive to load all the CSVs 
        and datapoints simultaneously.</p>
    <h3>Development Process:</h3>
    <p>Terence did the retrieving of the GOES data that we needed. 
        Siddhartha did the code to make the visualizations. 
        Cedric filtered the data to only include California's data.
        Steven and Cedric wrote the write-up. 
        We all had a hand in decisions/ideas and helped each other when needed.
        The development was a very long and difficult process.
        At first, we had a different compelling question, which was if natural disasters had an impact on the surface temperature.
        We chose to look at Hurricane Melissa, but upon looking at the region the hurricane affected, we found that the clouds of the hurricane blocked information that we needed.
        We had to pivot, since our original question was a dead-end, so we chose to look at clouds, specifically in California.
        We wanted to visualize the clouds across the daytime hours, hoping to see if it would tell us something about how clouds behaved over the course of a day.
        So we started by getting the cloud probability of the latest date available to us, which was November 5, 2025. 
        From here, we processed the data into CSV files, filtered the longitude and latitude to only be within California, and started working on the website. 
        We wanted viewers to be able to compare the clouds across the day, so we came up with the design of our website described above.
        Once we implemented the design, we added more details like highlighting major cities and adding a zoom feature that would zoom into both visualizations.
        That ended the development process and altogether took us a total of about 11 hours to finish.
        The most time-consuming parts were working on our first compelling question that didn't work out (about 4 hours) and the development of the website (about 5 hours).
